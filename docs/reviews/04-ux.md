# Review 4: UX Designer Flow Analysis

## Flow Mapping

**Flow A (Bakery Manager):**
/welcome → role select → /select-bakery → /dashboard → /entry → /summary

**Flow B (Strategic Manager):**
/welcome → role select → /select-bakery → /strategic → /history

**Flow C (Supervisor):**
/welcome → role select → /supervisor

## CRITICAL Issues

1. **Dead role selection route** - `src/app/(onboarding)/select-role/page.tsx:10`
   - /select-role is deprecated, only redirects to /welcome
   - Deep links may land on blank page briefly

2. **No back nav from /strategic** - `src/app/(main)/strategic/page.tsx:99`
   - Strategic Manager can only go back to welcome
   - No way to return to data entry screens

3. **Supervisor isolated from bakery data** - `src/app/(main)/supervisor/page.tsx`
   - Shows read-only dashboard with hardcoded demo data
   - No link to view actual bakery details or entries

## HIGH Issues

1. **Flow A requires 5 taps to start entry**
   - /welcome → role[1] → bakery[2] → dashboard[3] → see button[4] → tap entry[5]
   - No shortcut for returning users

2. **No loading state during bakery navigation** - `src/app/(onboarding)/select-bakery/page.tsx:31-33`
   - Uses setTimeout(300ms) but no spinner
   - Users may tap multiple times

3. **Back navigation inconsistent**
   - All use ArrowLeft Back button
   - No breadcrumb or page title context
   - Users can get disoriented

## MEDIUM Issues

1. **Loading states visual-only**
   - Shows spinner but doesn't prevent interaction
   - disabled only on save button, not full page

2. **No confirmation on data loss**
   - Clicking Back without saving = silent data loss

3. **Week label positioning** - `src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx:166`
   - "Week of {weekLabel}" small and easy to miss

4. **Summary doesn't link back properly** - `src/app/(main)/summary/page.tsx:359`
   - "Update Today's Entry" goes to /entry but doesn't pre-populate

5. **Strategic bakery selector lacks emphasis** - `src/app/(main)/strategic/page.tsx:116`
   - Native HTML select, no visual emphasis on current selection

## LOW Issues

1. **Transitions use hardcoded timeouts**
   - setTimeout(300ms) before navigation
   - Could cause visual artifacts on slow networks

2. **Font size inconsistency**
   - Dashboard: text-2xl, Entry: text-xl, Summary: text-xl
   - No design system consistency
